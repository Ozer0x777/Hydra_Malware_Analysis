# Hydra Malware Analysis

This is a Python script that allows you to submit one or more files to multiple malware analysis services, including Malware Bazar, Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis, and Joe Sandbox.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
   ``` 
   git clone https://github.com/Ozer0x777/Hydra_Malware_Analysis/
   ``` 
2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    ``` 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ``` 
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository, and add your API keys as environment variables. Here is an example `.env` file:

    ```  
    MALWARE_BAZAR_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    VIRUS_TOTAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    HYBRID_ANALYSIS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    JOE_SANDBOX_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```  

    You can obtain API keys for each service by following the links below:

    - [Malware Bazar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/api/)
    - [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us)
    - [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/signup/api)
    - [Joe Sandbox](https://www.joesandbox.com/signup)


### Usage

To submit one or more files, run the script with the file paths as arguments. For example, to submit two files located in the `samples` directory, you can run:
    
    python Hydra_Malware_Analysis.py samples/file1.exe samples/file2.exe
 

This will submit the files to Malware Bazar, Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis, and Joe Sandbox, and write the results to a CSV file named `results.csv`.

You can also use the `-h` or `--help` option to see the list of available arguments:


    python Hydra_Malware_Analysis.py -h
